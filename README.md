# Heart Disease Classification

This repository contains a machine learning solution to predict heart disease risk based on patient data. We evaluate the performance of 8 different models, apply state-of-the-art techniques for data handling, address class imbalance, and perform hyperparameter optimization to ensure the best model performance.

Models Used:

- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

- Logistic Regression (LR)

- Decision Trees (DT)

- Random Forests (RF)

- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

- Na√Øve Bayes (NB)

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

## Key Techniques
* Stratified k-fold cross-validation for model evaluation and class imbalance

* Randomized Hyperparameter Optimization using RandomSearch

* Statistical Testing to scientifically back up results

* Visualization and evaluation using various plots and metrics
